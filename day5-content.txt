Day 5 content is too large for a single edit. I'll add it in parts to the CourseDetail.jsx file.

The content includes:
- 3 Articles: Python Dictionary, Python Tuple, Python Sets
- 5 Problems with detailed examples
- 10 MCQ quiz questions

Due to token limits, I'll need to insert this content directly into the file using multiple smaller edits.
