# Progress Tracking System - Implementation Guide

## Overview

The progress tracking system has been completely redesigned to provide comprehensive, dynamic tracking for every student across all course activities including articles, problems, quizzes, days, weeks, and full courses. Both students and administrators have dedicated views with detailed analytics.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Progress Model (`/server/models/Progress.js`)

The Progress model now tracks:

#### Detailed Activity Tracking
- **Articles**: Tracks completion with time spent on each article
- **Problems**: Records difficulty, points earned, attempts, and time spent
- **Quizzes**: Stores scores, total questions, attempts, and time spent

#### Granular Progress Metrics
- **Day Progress**: Track completion per day with articles, problems, and quizzes count
- **Week Progress**: Aggregate weekly statistics with completed days tracking
- **Overall Statistics**: Total time spent, points earned, and completion percentages

#### Engagement Metrics
- **Current Streak**: Days of consecutive learning activity
- **Longest Streak**: Best streak achieved
- **Last Activity Date**: Automatic tracking of last learning session

### 2. Comprehensive API Endpoints (`/server/routes/progressRoutes.js`)

#### Student Endpoints
- `GET /api/progress/:courseId` - Get basic progress for a course
- `GET /api/progress/:courseId/detailed` - Get detailed breakdown with all metrics
- `POST /api/progress/:courseId/lesson` - Mark lesson as complete
- `POST /api/progress/:courseId/article` - Mark article complete (with time tracking)
- `POST /api/progress/:courseId/problem` - Mark problem complete (with difficulty, points, time)
- `POST /api/progress/:courseId/quiz` - Mark quiz complete (with score, attempts)
- `POST /api/progress/:courseId/day` - Update day-level progress
- `GET /api/progress/user/stats` - Get overall user statistics across all courses

#### Admin/Instructor Endpoints
- `GET /api/progress/admin/course/:courseId` - Get all students' progress for a course
- `GET /api/progress/admin/student/:userId/:courseId` - Get specific student's detailed progress

### 3. Student Progress View (`/client/src/components/course/ProgressTab.jsx`)

Features for students:
- **Overall Progress Dashboard**: Visual cards showing progress percentage, total points, time spent, and current streak
- **Category Breakdown**: Separate sections for articles, problems, and quizzes with completion lists
- **Weekly Progress**: Visual representation of progress by week
- **Streak Tracking**: Current and longest streak display with motivational messaging
- **Recent Activity**: Last 5 completed items in each category
- **Time Analytics**: Total time spent on learning activities

### 4. Admin Progress Dashboard (`/client/src/pages/admin/StudentProgressDashboard.jsx`)

Features for administrators and instructors:
- **Student List View**: Sortable table with all students' progress
- **Search & Filter**: Find students by name or email
- **Sort Options**: By progress, points, time spent, or name
- **Summary Statistics**: 
  - Total students enrolled
  - Average progress across all students
  - Average points earned
  - Number of active students
- **Detailed Student View**: Click to see individual student's complete progress breakdown
- **Visual Progress Bars**: Quick visual indication of each student's progress
- **Activity Tracking**: See articles, problems, and quizzes completed by each student

### 5. Integration with Course Detail Page

The Progress tab is now available in the course navigation alongside:

## API Usage Examples

### Marking an Article as Complete
```javascript
import { progressAPI } from './services/api';

// Mark article complete with time tracking
await progressAPI.markArticleComplete(
  courseId,
  articleId,
  timeSpent // in seconds
);
```

### Marking a Problem as Complete
```javascript
await progressAPI.markProblemComplete(
  courseId,
  problemId,
  'Medium', // difficulty
  10, // points
  300, // timeSpent in seconds
  1 // attempts
);
```

### Marking a Quiz as Complete
```javascript
await progressAPI.markQuizComplete(
  courseId,
  quizId,
  85, // score percentage
  10, // totalQuestions
  600 // timeSpent in seconds
);
```

### Getting Detailed Progress (Student)
```javascript
const response = await progressAPI.getDetailedProgress(courseId);
const progressData = response.data.data;
// Access: progressData.overall, progressData.articles, etc.
```

### Getting All Students' Progress (Admin)
```javascript
const response = await progressAPI.getCourseStudentsProgress(courseId);
const studentsProgress = response.data.data;
```

## Database Schema

### Progress Document Structure
```javascript
{
  user: ObjectId, // Reference to User
  course: ObjectId, // Reference to Course
  
  // Completed items
  completedLessons: [{ lessonId, completedAt }],
  completedArticles: [{ articleId, timeSpent, completedAt }],
  completedProblems: [{ 
    problemId, 
    attempts, 
    timeSpent, 
    difficulty, 
    points, 
    completedAt 
  }],
  completedQuizzes: [{ 
    quizId, 
    score, 
    totalQuestions, 
    attempts, 
    timeSpent, 
    completedAt 
  }],
  
  // Week/Day tracking
  weekProgress: [{
    weekId,
    completedDays: [String],
    articlesCompleted,
    problemsCompleted,
    quizzesCompleted,
    progressPercentage,
    lastAccessedAt
  }],
  dayProgress: [{
    dayId,
    weekId,
    articlesCompleted,
    problemsCompleted,
    quizzesCompleted,
    progressPercentage,

  }],
  
  // Overall statistics
  totalTimeSpent: Number, // in seconds
  totalArticlesCompleted: Number,
  totalProblemsCompleted: Number,
  totalQuizzesCompleted: Number,
  totalPoints: Number,
  overallProgress: Number, // 0-100

}
```

## Automatic Features

### Streak Calculation
The system automatically calculates streaks:
- Updates on every progress save
- Increments streak for consecutive days
- Resets streak if a day is missed
- Tracks longest streak achieved

### Progress Percentages
Progress percentages are automatically calculated based on:
- Number of completed items vs total items
- Weighted average across different activity types
- Real-time updates as students complete activities

## Testing the System

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test Student View**:
   - Log in as a student
   - Navigate to a course
   - Click the Progress tab
   - Verify all metrics display correctly
   - Complete an article/problem/quiz
   - Refresh and verify progress updates

2. **Test Admin View**:
   - Log in as admin/instructor
   - Navigate to a course
   - Click the Progress tab
   - Verify student list displays
   - Test search functionality
   - Test sorting options
   - Click "View Details" on a student
   - Verify detailed progress displays

3. **Test API Endpoints**:
   ```bash
   # Get student progress
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:5001/api/progress/COURSE_ID/detailed
   
   # Mark article complete
   curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"articleId":"1-1-a1","timeSpent":300}' \
     http://localhost:5001/api/progress/COURSE_ID/article
   ```

## Future Enhancements

## Troubleshooting

### Progress Not Updating
- Check that the API endpoints are being called correctly
- Verify authentication token is valid
- Check browser console for errors
