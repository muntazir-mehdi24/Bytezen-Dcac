---

## 🖼️ **Image Upload System**

### **Cloudinary Integration:**
All images are uploaded to Cloudinary and URLs are saved to MongoDB.

**Supported in:**

- ✅ Events (banner - single image)
- ✅ ByteLogs (thumbnail - single image)
- ✅ Council (member photo - single image)
- ✅ Partners (logo - single image)
- ✅ Testimonials (student photo - single image)

**Flow:**
```
User uploads image → Multer saves temporarily
→ Cloudinary uploads → Returns URL
→ URL saved to MongoDB → Temp file deleted
```

---

## 🔐 **Authentication**

All admin routes are protected:
```javascript
// Frontend sends token
const token = await user.getIdToken();
api.get('/students', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
});

// Backend verifies token
verifyToken middleware → Checks Firebase token → Allows/Denies
```
