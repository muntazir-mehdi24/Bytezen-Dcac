# Admin Panel Fixes - Complete Summary

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### **1. AdminDashboard - Showing Wrong Student Count**
**Problem:** Dashboard showed 19 students instead of 46 (hardcoded values)

**Solution:**
- Replaced hardcoded stats with real API calls
- Now fetches from `/api/students`, `/api/courses`, `/api/events`, `/api/insights`
- Displays accurate real-time counts

**Files Changed:**
- `client/src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.jsx`

---

### **2. Events Management - Not Fetching/Saving Data**
**Problem:** Event model missing required fields, routes not handling all data

**Solution:**
- **Updated Event Model** (`server/models/Event.js`):
  - Added: `time`, `location`, `eventType`, `mode`
  - Added: `registrationLink`, `maxParticipants`, `isPublished`
  - Made `createdBy` optional

- **Updated Event Routes** (`server/routes/eventRoutes.js`):
  - Changed from `upload.array('images')` to `upload.single('image')`
  - Added all new fields to create/update endpoints
  - Added toggle publish endpoint: `PATCH /api/events/:id/toggle`
  - Fixed delete to use `findByIdAndDelete`

**Files Changed:**
- `server/models/Event.js`
- `server/routes/eventRoutes.js`

---

### **3. ByteLog Management - Not Fetching/Saving Data**
**Problem:** Insight model expected ObjectId for author, frontend sends string

**Solution:**
- **Updated Insight Model** (`server/models/Insight.js`):
  - Changed `author` from ObjectId to String (author name)
  - Added `authorId` field for user reference
  - Made `thumbnailUrl` optional

- **Updated Insight Routes** (`server/routes/insightRoutes.js`):
  - Accept `author` as string from frontend
  - Handle `tags` as both string and array
  - Added toggle publish endpoint: `PATCH /api/insights/:id/publish`
  - Fixed boolean parsing for `isPublished`

**Files Changed:**
- `server/models/Insight.js`
- `server/routes/insightRoutes.js`

---

### **4. Backend Import Errors (Deployment Issues)**
**Problems:**
- Missing `.js` extensions in imports
- Wrong middleware function names
- Incorrect file upload configurations

**Solutions:**
- Fixed Partner model import: `'../models/Partner'` → `'../models/Partner.js'`
- Fixed auth middleware: `verifyToken` → `protect`
- Fixed file upload: Replaced `fileUpload` with proper `multer` configuration
- Updated all route files: `eventRoutes.js`, `councilRoutes.js`, `insightRoutes.js`, `partnerRoutes.js`

**Files Changed:**
- `server/controllers/partnerController.js`
- `server/routes/courseContentRoutes.js`
- `server/routes/studentRoutes.js`
- `server/routes/eventRoutes.js`
- `server/routes/councilRoutes.js`
- `server/routes/insightRoutes.js`
- `server/routes/partnerRoutes.js`
