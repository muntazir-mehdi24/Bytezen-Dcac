# Database Data Check

## Issue
The admin dashboard is showing 0 for all counts because the database collections are empty.

## What's Happening
✅ API calls are working (no 401 errors)
✅ Authentication is working (user is logged in)
✅ Backend is running and responding
❌ Database collections have no data

## Collections That Need Data

### 1. Students Collection
- Currently: 0 students
- Expected: 46 students (as you mentioned)
- Collection: `students`

### 2. Events Collection
- Currently: 0 events
- Collection: `events`

### 3. Insights Collection (ByteLogs)
- Currently: 0 insights
- Collection: `insights`

### 4. Courses Collection
- Currently: 0 courses
- Collection: `courses`

## How to Check Your Database

### Option 1: MongoDB Compass
1. Open MongoDB Compass
2. Connect to your database
3. Check these collections: `students`, `events`, `insights`, `courses`
4. Verify if they have documents

### Option 2: MongoDB Atlas Dashboard
1. Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Navigate to your cluster
3. Click "Browse Collections"
4. Check if data exists

## Possible Reasons for Empty Database

1. **Using Different Database**
   - Local dev might be pointing to a different MongoDB instance
   - Production backend uses MongoDB Atlas
   - Local backend might use local MongoDB

2. **Data Not Migrated**
   - Old data might be in a different database
   - Need to export from old DB and import to new DB

3. **Fresh Database**
   - This is a new deployment with no data yet
   - Need to add data through the admin panel

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Add Data Through Admin Panel
Use the admin panel to manually add:
- Students (Student Management)
- Events (Events Management)
- ByteLogs (ByteLog Management)
- Course content (Course Content Management)

### Solution 2: Import Existing Data
If you have data in another database:
1. Export from old database
2. Import to current database
3. Verify collections

### Solution 3: Use Seed Script
Create and run a seed script to populate test data

## Next Steps

1. **Verify which database your backend is connected to**
   - Check `server/.env` file
   - Look for `MONGODB_URI` or `MONGO_URI`

2. **Check if you have data elsewhere**
   - Do you have a local MongoDB with data?
   - Do you have a backup or export?

3. **Decide on approach**
   - Import existing data
   - OR start fresh and add through admin panel

## To Check Backend Database Connection

Look at your server logs when it starts. It should show:
```
MongoDB Connected: <cluster-name>
```

This tells you which database it's connected to.
